# About Me

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Otto, where I build mobile and web applications that make veterinary staff's lives easier. I specialize in React Native and full-stack development. When I'm not at a keyboard, I'm chasing my two kids around, spending time with my wife, or lifting heavy things in my garage gym.

## My Journey

I started teaching myself web development in high school to make my MySpace profile stand out. I learned I could write a simple html file in notepad and load it in a browser - I was hooked. That led to building a site for a local nonprofit, which caught the eye of a computer store owner who hired me to build sites for local businesses.

After graduating from Anderson University with a CS degree, I joined Interactive Intelligence as a Software Engineer in Test. After two years and an accquisition by Genesys, I transitioned to dceveloping the same application I'd been testing. It was a welcome change - I missed building.

A few years later, my role was outsourced, and I took a contract position at Pawru. During this time, I decided to learn React Native bu building something I wanted to use: Simpledex. I loved playing Pokémon games but hated wading through walls of wiki text just to find out how to evolve a specific Pokémon. So I built an app that surfaced exactly that information - nothing more. When I got Simpledex into the app stores, I felt that same rush I'd felt in high school opening my first HTML file in a browser. People could find my app, install it, and use it on their phones!

When Pawru and Otto (then TeleVet) merged, Otto offered me a role building their React Native mobile app. After shipping that app, I transitioned into a full-stack development and began leveling up my backend skills. Today, I'm a Tech Lead working toward Staff Engineer, mentoring junior developers, and building products that serve thousands of veterinary practices across North America.

## Faith

I believe in God. I believe that God sent Jesus Christ to die for our sins. I believe that Christ defeated death and that through Him we can have eternal life. My faith shapes everything I do - from how I lead my family to how I serve my teammates. I believe work is worship, and I approach every line of code and every code review with that in mind.

## Life Outside Code

When I close my laptop, I'm fully present with my family - playing with my two kids, supporting my wife, or just being together. I lift weights 5+ days a week, not for aesthetics but to stay strong enough to be useful - to keep up with my kids now and be present for them (and their kids) decades from now. I also unwind by playing guitar and gaming on Xbox and Switch.

## What I Value

I value faith, family, and freedom: in that order. Jesus is Lord and I follow His example. I lead and support my family based on His teachings. I value work that honors these priorities and allows me to serve others well.
