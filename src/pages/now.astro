    <h3>Fitness</h3>
    <p>
      I'm finally going to start paying for fitness programming again. I'm
      currently on a trial for Ladder. I also want to try out Street Parking,
      Chalk, and beyond the whiteboard before financially committing to one.

    <p>
      Still looking for a better way to track my benchmarks. Currently using
      notes on my phone. This is probably going to turn into my next project.

    <h3>Playing</h3>
    <p>
      I stopped playing Hogwarts Legacy; I was getting bored. I started playing
      Blasphemous and am having a great time. I have no idea what the story is
      but I really enjoy the mechanics and difficulty.

    <p>
      Still learning terminal based tools like vim, tmux, mutt and more. I'm
      also learning how to use AI tools to improve my productivity.
