    <h3>Fitness</h3>
    <p>
      Following a CrossFit style program on instagram in my garage gym. Working
      on building strength and endurance. Gym is still a work in progress but
      has everything I need to get in some great workouts.

      Another goal I have is to increase flexibility. I'm looking at various yoga programs but for now I've just been making sure I do a good amount of stretching after my workouts.

    <h3>Playing</h3>
    <p>
      I recently finished the Guacamelee games and moved on to Dead Cells. Got
      bored with that and picked up Hades and have been having tons of fun. I
      just finished Mario Wonder and picked up Cuphead, Hogwarts Legacy, and
      Prince of Persia Lost Crown.
