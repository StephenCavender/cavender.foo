      Following a CrossFit style program on instagram in my garage gym. Working
      on building strength and endurance. Gym is still a work in progress but
      has everything I need to get in some great workouts.

    <h3>Playing</h3>
    <p>
      I recently finished the Guacamelee games and moved on to Dead Cells. Got
      bored with that and picked up Hades and have been having tons of fun. I
      just finished Mario Wonder and picked up Cuphead, Hogwarts Legacy, and
      Prince of Persia Lost Crown.
