    <h3>Fitness</h3>
    <p>
      Following a CrossFit style program on instagram in my garage gym. Working
      on building strength and endurance. Gym is still a work in progress but
      has everything I need to get in some great workouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another goal I have is to increase flexibility. I'm looking at various
      yoga programs but for now I've just been making sure I do a good amount of
      stretching after my workouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking for a better way to track my benchmarks. Currently using notes on
      my phone.
