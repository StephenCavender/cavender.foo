# Work With Me

**Updated November 11, 2025**

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Otto, where I build mobile and web applications for the veterinary industry. I like building things to improve peoples' lives.

I'm happy in my current role and selective about new opportunities, but open to conversations about exceptional positions - especially those involving React Native.

## What I Bring to Your Team
10+ years of building software across startups and enterprise companies:
- **Mobile expertise:** Built and shipped Otto's React Native mobile app from scratch, used by thousands of veterinary practices across North America
- **Full-stack capabilities:** Comfortable across the entire stack - TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma
- **Technical leadership:** Currently serving as Tech Lead, mentoring junior engineers and driving architectural decisions
- **Proven delivery:** Known for shipping high-quality features quickly while maintaining code quality and team velocity
- **Product mindset:** I build solutions for users, not just tickets for backlogs

**Tech I enjoy:** React Native, TypeScript, Next.js, Expo, tRPC, Postgres

## What Interests Me
I'm drawn to opportunities that involve:
- **Impact-driven product work** - Building things that solve real problems for real people
- **Technical leadership** - Architecture, mentorship, and raising the bar without leaving IC work behind
- **Modern tech stacks** - Teams that embrace current best practices and tooling
- **Sustainable culture** - Places that value craft, learning, and work-life balance
- **Values alignment** - Work that respects faith, family, and personal commitments

**Role preferences:**
- Senior or Staff IC positions
- Full-stack or mobile-focused roles (React Native is my sweet spot)
- Product companies building their own software (not agencies or consultancies)
- Remote or hybrid positions (based in Warsaw, Indiana)

## What Doesn't Work for Me
To save us both time, I'm typically not a great fit for:
- Roles requiring extensive travel or relocation
- Contract, freelance, or staff augmentation positions
- Companies with cultures that don't respect boundaries
- Work that would conflict with my personal values
