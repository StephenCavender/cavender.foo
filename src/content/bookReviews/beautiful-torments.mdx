## Review

I was immediately hooked on this book. Thoroughly enjoyed the writing style of the author. I could easily envision every scene and felt like I was there with the characters.

The story itself is new, refreshing, and unexpected. I found myself surprised multiple times. For the last several chapters I couldn't put it down!

I highly recommend this book and am very much looking forward to more in the series!
