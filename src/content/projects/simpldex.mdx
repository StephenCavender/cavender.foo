Every pokèdex app out there has every bit of information a person could ever want: location, height, weight, characteristics, likes, dislikes... Whenever I play any of the games I'm only trying to learn if and how a pokèmon I caught will evolve. So I decided to learn React Native and write the app I wanted.

SimpleDex is a quick and easy tool for figuring out if a pokèmon evolves and the conditions that need to be met for it to happen.
