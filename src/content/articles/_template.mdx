# Article Title

This is a template file for creating new articles. Replace this content with your actual article.

## How to Use This Template

1. Make a copy of this file with a descriptive filename (use kebab-case like `my-article-name.mdx`)
2. Update the frontmatter section (between the `---` markers) with your article details
3. Write your content using Markdown and MDX features
4. Set `draft: false` when ready to publish

## Frontmatter Fields

- **title**: The main title of your article
- **description**: A brief summary (good for SEO)
- **pubDate**: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **updatedDate**: Date of last update (optional)
- **tags**: Array of relevant tags (used for categorization)
- **draft**: Set to `true` to keep it as a draft (only visible in development)

## Writing Tips

### Structure

Use headings (`##`, `###`) to organize your content logically. A clear structure helps readers navigate your article.

### Code Blocks

```js
// You can include code snippets like this
function example() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Images

If you need to include images, place them in the appropriate location and reference them:

```md
![Alt text description](/path/to/image.jpg)
```

### Links

Link to internal pages: [Link Text](/path)
Link to external sites: [Link Text](https://example.com)

## SEO Best Practices

- Use a descriptive title that includes keywords
- Write a compelling description (150-160 characters)
- Include relevant tags
- Use appropriate heading levels
- Include alt text for all images

## Publishing

When your article is ready:
1. Set `draft: false` in the frontmatter
2. Ensure all links and images work correctly
3. Check for any spelling or grammatical errors
