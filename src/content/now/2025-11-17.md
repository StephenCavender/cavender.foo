## Projects

- **Digital Garden**:
  - Converting the astro pages plain markdown
  - Updating content

See a full list of projects (past, present, and future) [here](/projects)

## Fitness

About 2 months ago I switched teams on Ladder. I'm now on Team Crews Control. I enjoy these workouts as well but see myself switching between this and Team Resilient every now and then.

## Playing

- **Halo Infinite**: I have a standing Halo night every week.
- **Blasphemous II**: Nearing the endgame and finishing up as many side quests as I can.

## Reading

- **Million Dollar Weekend**: A friend lent me this book after we discussed what's holding me back from starting one of my side project ideas. I haven't started it yet but plan on reading it and more through the holidays.

## Learning

- Still focused on learning terminal based tools: vim, tmux, mutt, etc.
- I've also been reading a lot about hosting my own LLM

## Goals

For the next 3 months:

- Write 6 articles for the Garden
- Read a book
- Start a side project
- Fix bulleted lists styling...
