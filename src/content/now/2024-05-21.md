## Projects

This site is my only current project

## Fitness

Still using Ladder for my training and really enjoying it. I'm on Team Resilient with Coach Neen. The workouts are great and I'm starting to put on some muscle.

Another goal I have is to increase flexibility. I'm looking at various yoga programs but for now I've just been making sure I do a good amount of stretching after my workouts.

Looking for a better way to track my benchmarks. Currently using notes on my phone.

## Reading

The Dichotomy of Leadership but haven't picked it up in a while.

## Playing

I'm really enjoying Hogwarts Legacy! I'm not paying much attention to story but having a lot of run exploring the world.

## Learning

I'm trying to improve my productivity and have started learning terminal based tools like vim, tmux, mutt and more.
