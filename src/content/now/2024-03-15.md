## Projects

This site is my only current project

## Fitness

Following a CrossFit style program on instagram in my garage gym. Working on building strength and endurance. Gym is still a work in progress but has everything I need to get in some great workouts.

## Reading

The Dichotomy of Leadership but haven't picked it up in a while.

## Playing

I recently finished the Guacamelee games and moved on to Dead Cells. Got bored with that and picked up Hades and have been having tons of fun. I just finished Mario Wonder and picked up Cuphead, Hogwarts Legacy, and Prince of Persia Lost Crown.
